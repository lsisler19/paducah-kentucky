Change in Paducah Kentucky

Paducah, Kentucky is a city in Western Kentucky. It has experienced quite a bit of development and change over the past years. There is some demolishing of things like a building, but mostly new development and growth.

Paducah is where my mom's family is from; so this new devopment will have made this place look a little differnt, from when I was last there.
